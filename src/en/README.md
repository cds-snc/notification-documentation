# Integrate the API

::: warning Communicating during caretaker period
Some communications are prohibited during a federal election. Check with your communications branch if you’re not sure you can send an announcement or other message. For more information, read [the Guidelines](https://www.canada.ca/en/privy-council/services/publications/guidelines-conduct-ministers-state-exempt-staff-public-servants-election.html).

This documentation is for developers who want to integrate the [GC Notify](https://notification.canada.ca/) application programming interface (API) with their department's web application or back office system. If you’re not a developer or to learn how to use GC Notify outside of the API, visit [Guidance](https://notification.canada.ca/guidance)

Integrating the GC Notify API allows you to send email or text messages automatically. You might do this if you have a system that tracks a business process, so that whenever there's a status change, your clients could receive a notification about the update.
