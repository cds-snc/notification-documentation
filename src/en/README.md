# Integrate the API

This documentation is for developers who want to integrate the [GC Notify](https://notification.canada.ca/) application programming interface (API) with their department's web application or back office system. If youâ€™re not a developer or to learn how to use GC Notify outside of the API, visit [Guidance](https://notification.canada.ca/guidance)

Integrating the GC Notify API allows you to send email or text messages automatically. You might do this if you have a system that tracks a business process, so that whenever there's a status change, your clients could receive a notification about the update.
