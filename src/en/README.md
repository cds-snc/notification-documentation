# Integrate the API

This documentation is for developers who want to integrate the GC Notify application programming interface (API) with their department's web application or back office system.

Integrating the GC Notify API allows you to send email or text messages automatically. You might do this if you have a system that tracks a business process, so that whenever there's a status change, your clients could receive a notification about the update.
